## Project Evolution

This project started as a console-based Rock Paper Scissors game using `prompt()` and `alert()` for user interaction. It has since been refactored with a modern, interactive UI that demonstrates practical DOM manipulation skills including:

- Selecting and modifying DOM elements
- Event listener implementation
- Dynamic content updates
- Modal creation and management
- Responsive design principles

## Files

- `index.html` - Game markup and modal structure
- `styles.css` - Styling and responsive design
- `script.js` - Game logic and DOM interactions

## Future Improvements

- Add sound effects for wins/losses
- Implement different difficulty levels
- Add game statistics/history
- Dark/Light theme toggle
- Multiplayer mode
